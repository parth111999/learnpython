# then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
# you can use range(start, stop, increment). Example: range(0, 6, 2):
for i in range(0, 6, 1): # or elements = range(0,6)
    print(f"Adding {i} to the list")
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)

# now we can print them out too
